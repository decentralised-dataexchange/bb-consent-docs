# User Access

In user access page, the organisation admin can perform following:

1. Create/Read/Update/Delete identity provider configuration. Identity provider configuration enables an organisation admin to onboard individuals from their existing IT systems to consent BB. For e.g. Radisson hotels can configure IDP and then their existing users can login using radisson credentials.
2. Bulk onboard individuals using CSV file upload. In this case, individuals will be created in consent BB IDP.
