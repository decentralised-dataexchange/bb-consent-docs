### Data Agreements

In data agreements page, the organisation admin can perform following:

1. Create/Update global policy configuration. This has to be done prior to creating a data agreement. Data policy configuration in a data agreement is pre-filled with default values from global policy configuration during creation.
2. Create/Read/Update/Delete data agreements
3. There are 2 ways a data agreement can be created - 1) in draft mode 2) in publish mode
4. Draft data agreements are not visible to individuals using privacy dashboard. Only published data agreements are visible to individuals.
5. It is also possible to access list of all data agreements as a table. This list is paginated (in fact all the listing APIs are paginated)
6. Organisation admin can filter the list of data agreements to see 1) all data agreements 2) draft data agreements 3) published data agreements
