    The Consent Building Block enables services for individuals to approve
    the use  of their personal data by defining the principles, functions, and architecture  of
    an information system. For organisations that process personal data, it  provides
    the ability to know the individual's will and legitimately process such  personal
    data. The Consent Building Block is a process-oriented GovStack Building Block  facilitating
    auditable bilateral data-agreements within a multi-agent environment that  integrates
    with most other Building Blocks.
