  description: >
    The Consent Building Block enables services for individuals to approve the use 
    of their personal data by defining the principles, functions, and architecture 
    of an information system. For organisations that process personal data, it 
    provides the ability to know the individual's will and legitimately process such 
    personal data. The Consent Building Block is a process-oriented GovStack Building Block 
    facilitating auditable bilateral agreements within a multi-agent environment that 
    integrates with most other Building Blocks.
